# 📊 EDA - 1 (Google Play Store Data)

Welcome to my first Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! In this notebook, I have performed a detailed EDA on the **Google Play Store dataset**, uncovering key insights and cleaning the data for further machine learning tasks.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about apps available on the Google Play Store, including:

- App name
- Category
- Rating
- Number of installs
- Type (Free/Paid)
- Price
- Size
- Content rating
- Genres
- Last updated
- Current version
- Android version

---

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed

### ✅ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values
- Fixed data types
- Cleaned columns like Size, Installs, and Price
- Removed duplicates and invalid entries

### ✅ Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of app ratings
- Most common app categories
- Distribution of app sizes and installs

### ✅ Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
- Relationship between app rating and number of installs
- Price comparison across categories
- Category-wise average ratings

### ✅ Outlier Detection & Handling
- Identified and capped/remediated outliers in numerical columns

### ✅ Visualizations
- Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, bar charts
- Heatmaps for correlation matrix

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Free apps dominate the Play Store.
- Most apps have a rating between 4.0 and 4.5.
- Categories like **Games** and **Tools** are the most populated.
- Paid apps tend to have slightly higher ratings.
- App size does not strongly correlate with rating.

# 📊 EDA - 2 (HR Employee Data)

Welcome to my second Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! In this notebook, I have analyzed an **HR dataset** containing detailed information about employees — aiming to understand patterns related to attrition, performance, and workplace behavior.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains various attributes related to employees, including:

- Satisfaction Level  
- Last Evaluation Score  
- Number of Projects  
- Average Monthly Hours  
- Time Spent at Company  
- Work Accident History  
- Promotion in Last 5 Years  
- Department  
- Salary Level  
- Employee Attrition (Left or Stayed)

---

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed

### ✅ Data Cleaning
- Checked for and handled missing values  
- Verified and corrected data types  
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries

### ✅ Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of satisfaction levels and evaluations  
- Frequency of departments and salary levels  
- Attrition counts (left vs stayed)

### ✅ Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
- Relationship between satisfaction and attrition  
- Department-wise attrition trends  
- Impact of average monthly hours on employee retention

### ✅ Outlier Detection & Handling
- Detected outliers in numerical features (e.g., working hours)  
- Treated outliers using capping techniques

### ✅ Visualizations
- Histograms, box plots, count plots  
- Bar graphs comparing categorical features  
- Heatmaps showing feature correlations

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Low satisfaction level is a strong indicator of employee attrition.  
- Employees working extremely high or low hours tend to leave more.  
- Certain departments show higher attrition rates than others.  
- Salary level influences retention — lower salary tiers see more exits.  
- Promotion and work accidents also correlate with employee behavior.
